              to hike to a view of Mendenhall glacier followed by a humpback whale watching tour.
              After nearly missing the bus ride to the glacier, losing our group as soon as we
              arrived, and with the rain pouring down, we hiked a mile and half to a gravel beach
              framed by Mendenhall Glacier, a turquoise lake, and a glacier-fed waterfall. Elliott
              asked our tour guide to take a photo of us and after a few snapshots, got down on one
              knee to pop the question."
