# Mycah and Elliott's wedding site!

- https://elliottandmycah.com

Just a basic site with mostly static content for us to play around with various tech. :)

## I'm not a designer

Full disclosure. I'm not a website designer and kind of suck at it, but I do know how to build and host a website. 

## Dev

You can start the app with `yarn dev` and there are no tests yet. :( _sad womp_

Required tools:

- [nodejs/npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/)
